hi!
The common characteristics of projects are: they are carried out by people, they are subject to the constraints of limited resources, they are planned, executed and controlled.
The primary activities associated with operations are routine.
Projects are temporary, unique and complex activities, which aim to create a new product or service, while operations are primary, routine activities.
In a general sense, a project is the set of operations carried out in an organization, in order to achieve a goal.
Programs are a group of projects, managed in a coordinated manner, to obtain additional benefits.
Subprojects are components of a project that can be more easily controlled.
The key feature of the projects is that the products are developed progressively.
Temporality is the characteristic that a project has an end, which coincides with the fulfillment of its goals or with the impossibility of fulfilling its tasks.
Uniqueness is the characteristic that the products are unique and different from the purpose of the project.
PMI-USA defines project management as the application of knowledge, techniques, skills and specific tools in order to design activities that comply with the expectations of groups of beneficiaries (stakeholders).
Competitive demands in project management are scope, time and quality, identified and unidentified needs and user expectations.
The identified need is a clear and specific requirement, while the unidentified need is an unclear expectation or desire of the beneficiary.
APM-UK defines project management as the most efficient way to introduce changes in the structure of a system.
The tasks or objectives of a project are defined as unique, complex and connected activities that must be completed within time, cost and other technical and quality parameters.
A plan to fulfill the objectives of a project is developed by identifying the activities necessary to achieve the objectives, establishing deadlines and costs, and identifying the necessary resources.
The specific techniques used in project management are planning and scheduling, control and monitoring of progress, risk management, quality management and communication management.
The role of a Project Manager is to lead the project team and ensure the successful delivery of the desired result.
The successful delivery of the desired result in project management is achieved by planning and scheduling activities, controlling and monitoring progress, managing risks, managing quality and managing effective communications with all stakeholders.
The tools and techniques used in project management are planning and scheduling, control and monitoring of progress, risk management, quality management, communication management, resource management and budget management.
Common project constraints are time, cost, quality, resources and change.
The main responsibilities of the project manager are the coordination of all project activities, leading the team to achieve the set objectives and ensuring that the project is carried out according to the approved plan and budget.
The main objectives of leadership in project management are establishing the general direction of the project's evolution, aligning the staff to the leader's ideas, motivating and inspiring the staff.
Written and oral, internal and external, formal and informal, horizontal and vertical communication are used in project management.
The purposes of negotiation in project management are the establishment of the purpose, the cost, the agenda for achieving the objectives, the terms and conditions of the contract, the evaluation and the resources.
Problems are defined and solved by identifying causes and effects and by making a decision, which may be "correct" but not necessarily optimal.
The important stages of general project management are accounting/financial, sales and marketing, development/research, production and distribution; strategic planning, tactical planning, operational planning; organizational structures, organizational development, personnel administration, compensations, benefits; management of working relationships (motivation, delegation, supervision, construction of work groups, conflict management); individual management (personal working time management, stress management).
Organizational culture is the climate and practices that organizations develop in interaction with people. Values, mission, regulations, methods and procedures, motivation systems, organizational environment and change management are the key elements of organizational culture.
The main skills needed for a project management leader are leadership, communication, negotiation and problem solving.
Planning is essential in project management, because it helps to define objectives, establish the calendar and manage costs.
The control of expenses is ensured by monitoring and reporting them, comparing them with the approved budget and taking measures to fit within it.
Working relationship management refers to the ability to motivate, delegate, supervise and build effective work groups, as well as the ability to manage conflicts that may arise within the project.
Individual management refers to the skills and methods used to manage personal work time and manage stress effectively.
General project management is applied in areas such as accounting/financial, sales and marketing, development/research, production and distribution.
Strategic, tactical and operational planning helps to define long-term, medium-term and short-term objectives, respectively to ensure that they are achieved effectively.
An appropriate organizational structure for a project may include a management team, project teams and individual specialized positions. It is important to ensure that it is adapted to the needs of the project and that there is good communication and collaboration between team members.
Personnel management includes the recruitment, training and development of personnel, as well as the management of their compensation and benefits. Challenges may include attracting and retaining qualified staff, as well as managing their performance.

The project closing report should contain information such as the results obtained, the problems encountered and how they were solved, as well as recommendations for future projects.
The product purpose represents the functions and attributes that characterize a product or service, and the actual project scope represents the necessary resources (human or technological) to create a finished material that corresponds to the product scope.
Characteristics of a project scope might include describing the project in objective and unambiguous terms, identifying products, services, and other deliverables, defining out-of-scope items to eliminate misunderstandings, providing a shared vision, defining criteria for measuring success, and controlling the evolution of the goal.
The steps required to define the scope of a project might include stakeholder review and approval, identifying known issues or risks, defining project deliverables, defining project objectives, defining high-level requirements, identifying assumptions and exclusions, and defining project scope milestones.
Key elements in defining the scope of a project might include staffing, scope planning, WBS (work breakdown), scope function definition, scope management and the triple constraint.
Scope planning can include outputs such as the scope statement, which includes the project justification, the market need the project is to address, the project product/service, the project objectives, the accompanying elements of the project, high-level requirements, and assumptions and exclusions. Goal management describes how the goal will be achieved and how changes to the goal will be integrated into the project. The WBS (work breakdown) describes the work to be performed by the project team to achieve the project's objectives.
The scope function definition can include inputs such as product description, strategic plan, market requirement, product analysis, cost/benefit analysis, identification of alternatives, expert judgment, WBS, and WBS models.
The triple constraint in project management refers to the limitations imposed by the scope, duration, and cost of a project's objectives. The project manager must consider these three competing objectives and balance them to create a successful project.
A SMART goal is a specific, measurable, realistic, relevant and time-bound objective. This type of objective is used to ensure that the purpose of a project is clear, objective and measurable.
BHAG is an acronym for "Big Hairy Audacious Goal" and refers to an ambitious and challenging goal that can be achieved in the long term. This type of goal is used to motivate the team and provide a clear direction for the project.
OKR or Objectives and Key Performance Indicators is a method used to define and measure progress in achieving organizational or project goals.
Mind-mapping is a method of organizing ideas and gathering information by creating a visual structure that connects main ideas and related topics. It can be used in the process of defining the scope of a project to organize and connect the different aspects of the project and help identify the links and interdependencies between them.
Product analysis is a method used to gain a better understanding of project products. This may include techniques such as value analysis, engineering, functional analysis and others.
Cost/benefit analysis is a method used to estimate the costs and benefits of different project implementation alternatives and to evaluate the best alternative.
Identifying alternatives may include the use of brainstorming or lateral thinking techniques to generate and evaluate different options for carrying out the project.
Expert judgment involves using the knowledge and experience of specialists to evaluate different options and make decisions in the process of defining the scope of a project.
Work Breakdown (WBS) involves identifying the ultimate goal of the project, identifying major deliverables, breaking down these deliverables into additional levels, and revising and refining the WBS. This process helps to organize and plan the activities necessary to achieve the project objectives.
There are different WBS models, such as top-down, bottom-up, analogy and mind-mapping. Each model has advantages and disadvantages and may be more suitable for certain projects or goals.
Understanding the market need is important for justifying the project and defining its purpose. This may include analyzing the potential demand for the project's product or service and evaluating the competition.
High-level requirements are general specifications for the project, described at a summary level and may include a technical description of the project. They are used to define the purpose of the project and provide a shared vision of it.
Assumptions and exclusions are the responsibilities and decisions used to clarify the purpose of the project and remove ambiguities.
Project scope milestones are zero-duration events that mark the progress of the project throughout its life. They are used to monitor the progress of the project and ensure that it is moving towards achieving its goal.
Stakeholder review and approval is an important step in defining the purpose of a project. This helps formalize the purpose of the project and ensure that it is understood and accepted by all stakeholders involved.
Known problems or risks are the potential problems or risks of the project, which must be considered in the process of defining the scope and planning of the project.
Project deliverables are the expected results of the project, which must be defined and included in the project's goal definition and planning process.
Project objectives are the overall objectives that must meet the needs of the customers and fulfill the purpose of the project. They must be clearly defined and quantifiable.
Criteria for measuring success are used to assess whether the project has achieved its purpose and whether its objectives have been met.
Scope control is the process of monitoring and adapting the scope of the project as it evolves to reduce the impact on the organization and resources.
The employees are the people responsible for carrying out the project tasks and must be considered in the process of defining the scope and planning of the project.
The strategic plan is the document that describes the organization's strategy and how the project aligns with it. This should be considered in the project scoping and planning process to ensure that the project is aligned with the organization's goals.
Product analysis is a technique used to better understand project products, such as value analysis, engineering, functional analysis, etc.
Cost/benefit analysis is used to estimate the costs and benefits of different project implementation alternatives and to evaluate the best alternative.
Identifying alternatives can be done through brainstorming or lateral thinking techniques.
Expert judgment is used to obtain opinions and assessments from subject matter specialists to help define the scope and plan the project.
Top-down is a WBS model that is based on the decomposition of the objective into components, using a representation on levels of complexity.
Bottom-up is a WBS model that is based on starting with specific actions and organizing them towards objectives / results, using aggregation by components.
Analogy is a WBS model that is based on using existing models and modifying them as needed, influenced by the degree of similarity of objectives. This model requires the existence of documents from previous projects
Mind-mapping is a WBS model that is based on a collection of ideas linked together through a graphic structure.
Work Breakdown (WBS) involves identifying the end goal of the project, identifying major deliverables, additional levels of decomposition, and revising and refining the WBS.
Assumptions and exclusions are responsibilities and decisions used to clarify the purpose of the project.
Defining the project goal function is an ongoing process that involves revising and adapting the goal as the project evolves.
The principles used in time management are planning, prioritization, organization, delegation, and control. Practices include setting goals, setting deadlines, planning and scheduling, monitoring and evaluating progress, and optimizing the use of time. The necessary skills are the ability to make decisions, the ability to communicate, the ability to delegate, self-discipline, and the ability to manage several tasks at the same time. The systems used in time management are diaries, planners, task lists and mental maps.
The benefits of using time management are increasing productivity and efficiency, reducing stress, improving interpersonal relationships, and achieving goals.
The systemic model in time management includes the following stages: defining the activities, sequencing the activities, estimating the duration, developing the work agenda and controlling the work agenda.
The inputs to the activity definition process are the work agenda plan, the project goal, the work breakdown structure, the work constraints and assumptions, the reference materials, the organization's environmental factors and the organization's processes.
The outputs in the activity definition process are the list of activities, the attributes of the activities, the supporting materials and the process documentation.
The inputs to the work agenda control process are the project work agenda, performance reports and change requests and the work agenda management plan.
The outputs in the work agenda control process are project performance, corrective actions, updating the work agenda and process documentation.
The tools and techniques used in work agenda control are formal control policies and procedures, AOA network diagrams, probability technique, performance evaluation, change forecasting methods, project management software and change control system.
The conclusions about time management are that a more detailed planning is necessary to be able to follow the developed work agenda as well as possible and that the performance and availability of resources influence the duration of the activities and therefore of the project.
Time management can increase productivity by improving the organization of activities and by identifying and eliminating unnecessary or redundant activities. It can also help solve problems by identifying and prioritizing problems and planning and allocating the resources needed to solve those problems.
Time management can help maintain motivation and consistency in work by providing a clear framework for the activities to be accomplished, providing an action plan, and monitoring progress. This can help project members focus on important tasks, see progress, and feel like they are part of an important project.
Planning is important in time management to ensure that activities are completed on time, to avoid over- or under-utilization of resources, and to anticipate and manage problems that may arise.
The performance and availability of resources can affect the duration of activities and the project in general by delaying or accelerating the completion of activities, by the need to allocate additional resources, or by the need to reduce allocated resources.
A work agenda management plan is a document that describes how the project's progress will be managed and monitored over time.
Updating the work agenda involves reviewing and modifying the work plan based on progress made, issues identified, and changes needed to meet project objectives.
Corrective actions are additional activities that are implemented to bring the project back on track, to bring it in line with the project plan.
Good practices (Lessons learned) in time management are experiences and lessons learned during project management that can be documented and used to improve future project management.
Formal control policies and procedures used in time management may include rules and regulations for planning, monitoring and reporting project progress, as well as procedures for managing change and risk.
Performance in time management can be evaluated by comparing the progress achieved with the project plan, by analyzing specific performance indicators and by evaluating feedback from stakeholders.
Forecasting methods for time management changes can include "What-If" analyzes and simulations to estimate the potential impact of changes on the project.
Project management tools used in controlling the work schedule may include AOA network diagrams, probability techniques, and project management software.
In the work agenda management, the change control system includes the work agenda change variants (methods): tracking, approval system, etc.
In time management, additional planning may be necessary to manage changes in the project, such as estimating the duration of activities, modifying the sequence of activities, comparative analysis of work agendas (variants).
The PjM (Project Management) software is a tool used in project management that allows the planning, tracking and control of project activities and resources, as well as the generation of reports and project performance analyses. It can be used in time management to assist in planning, tracking and controlling the work agenda.
Cost management is the process of planning and controlling the budget of a project or business.
Cost management includes resource planning, cost estimating, cost budgeting and cost control.
Resource planning is the process of allocating and managing the resources needed for a project or business.
Cost estimation is the process of forecasting the costs required for a project or business.
Cost budgeting is the process of establishing a budget for a project or business.
Cost control is the process of monitoring and evaluating costs to ensure that they remain within the established budget.
Cost is the amount of money spent on producing or buying a good or providing a service.
Spending is the consumption of material means, work, energy to satisfy some needs.
Price is the monetary expression of the value of a good or service.
Consumption is the use of material goods and services in order to satisfy needs.
Cost management is the set of organization, management and cost management activities.
The cost is the living and materialized labor effort that an economic agent submits for the factory of a product, for the execution of a work or a service, the actual consumption of resources to obtain a result, while the expense represents a payment and appears in the scope of supply and sales.
The sphere of expenses can be included in the sphere of costs, because it is much wider and more complex.
Factors that contribute to price formation are production costs, supply and demand, competition and taxes.
The selling price is the selling price of a product or service.
Project-level cost management refers to cost management for a specific project, while business-level cost management refers to cost management for the entire business.
Cost is one of the most used criteria to define the success of a project because it is universally understood and easy to measure.
The benefits of cost management are: ensuring that the project or business is carried out within the budget, identifying and solving cost problems in a timely manner, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the project or business.
Resource planning is important in cost management because it allows the efficient allocation and management of the resources needed for the project or business, avoiding resource overload and reducing unnecessary costs.
Cost estimation is important in cost management because it allows the correct planning and budgeting of the project or business, forecasting the necessary costs, identifying and managing risks and ensuring that the project or business is carried out within the budget.
Budgeting is important in cost management because it provides a clear basis for monitoring and controlling project or business costs, encourages accountability, and provides a basis for decision-making.
Cost control is important in cost management because it allows monitoring and evaluating project or business costs, identifying and solving cost problems in a timely manner, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the project or business.
The origin of the word "cost" comes from the Latin "constare" which means to establish, to fix.
In Latin, the word "cost" means to establish or fix.
The transfer of value in the context of consumption refers to the transfer of value from production factors to services intended for sale or own consumption.
"Constare" from which the word "cost" comes means to establish or fix.
"Costa" from which the word "cost" comes, means the consumption of the production of an object.
"Payments made by an organization to third parties for the goods and services it benefits from and the implied value of any asset - labor, land, capital - that the company supplies itself" in terms of cost, refers to the amount the total amount of money paid by an organization for the necessary products and services and the implicit value of any good that the organization produces or supplies itself.
The difference between cost and payment is that cost is the total amount of money paid for the required products and services, while payment refers to an amount of money paid for a specific good or service.
The difference between expenditure and payment is that expenditure is the consumption of material means, work, energy to satisfy some needs, while payment refers to an amount of money paid for a specific good or service.
Quality management in projects refers to the process of establishing and maintaining an expected level of quality for a project, from the beginning to its completion.
The main benefits of meeting quality requirements in projects include the reduction of changes in projects, which means lower costs and higher satisfaction of stakeholders
The tools and techniques used for quality planning in projects include cost-benefit analysis, benchmarking, the use of cause-effect diagrams, flow charts of processes or systems, and design of experiments.
Internal factors that can affect the quality of a project include erroneous assessment of available resources and inadequate planning of project activities. External factors that can affect the quality of a project include changes in legal requirements or regulations and changes in economic or market conditions.
The stages of the activity cycle for quality improvement are: Plan, Realize, Check, Act.
The tools and techniques used for quality assurance in projects include quality audits and quality inspection, which are based on sampling and statistical control of processes.
The objectives of quality control in projects are to establish desired quality standards that are acceptable to customers, to discover defects or variations in raw materials and manufacturing processes to ensure smooth and uninterrupted production, and to evaluate methods and processes production and suggest improvements.
A quality problem can be corrected as soon as possible by identifying and analyzing the problem, establishing the cause, establishing and implementing the solution and monitoring the results.
The benefits of quality audits in projects are to identify problems and opportunities for improvement, to assess compliance with standards and regulations and to assess the need to improve project performance.
Statistical process control can be used to ensure quality in projects by identifying and analyzing process variations and taking measures to improve process performance.
The cycle of activities for quality improvement is a continuous process that includes the stages of planning, realization, verification and action, which is based on the feedback obtained from each stage to improve the performance of the project.
The purpose of quality audits in projects is to evaluate the performance of the project and to identify and correct problems and opportunities for improvement, so as to ensure compliance with standards and regulations and to improve the performance of the project.
Quality control is essential in project management, because it allows the identification and correction of quality problems as soon as possible, so as to save time and money.
The benefits of using diagrams in quality planning in projects are to identify and analyze the relationships between different problems and causes and to identify appropriate solutions to improve project performance.
Cost-benefit analysis is a technique used to estimate the costs and benefits of different design alternatives and can be used in quality management in projects to determine the best alternative to satisfy quality requirements and to reduce costs.
Benchmarking is a method of comparing the processes of the planned project with the best practices of other projects in the respective field or even in other fields, in order to obtain ideas for improving the processes and procedures by which performance is measured.
The cause-effect diagram is a tool used to establish the relationships between the various causes and the existing or potential problems they create, it can be used in quality planning to identify the causes of the problem and to find appropriate solutions to solve them.
Process or system flow charts are tools used to indicate the flow of data or elements of the process/system and therefore the ways in which the different elements of the process/system follow each other. They can be used in quality planning to identify and analyze processes and identify areas of risk and opportunities for improvement.
Design of experiments is an analytical technique that allows the identification of independent variables that have a major influence on the dependent variables that are measured during the experiment, it can be used in quality planning to evaluate different solutions and determine the best solution to meet the requirements quality.
Statistical process control can be used to ensure quality in projects by identifying and analyzing process variations and taking measures to improve process performance. This technique can be used in quality control to monitor and maintain process performance at an acceptable level and to guarantee compliance with quality standards and requirements.
Comprehensiveness, coherence, control, communication, credibility, involvement, change, competence, creativity and cost efficiency are the 10 essential characteristics for the efficiency of human resources management.
The objective of human resources management is to help the organization achieve its goals, the efficient use of the skills and abilities of the workforce, providing the organization with well-trained and motivated employees, increasing the level of employee satisfaction with the workplace, communicating personnel policies to all employees, maintaining professional ethics, helping to introduce beneficial changes for individuals, groups, organizations and the public.
The specific activities of human resources management are: Human resource planning; Elaboration of job descriptions; Recruitment, selection and orientation of human resources; Evaluation of individual and collective performances; Human resource development; Job specific rewards and benefits; Staff health and safety; Discipline, control and evaluation of staff functions and Work Scheduling.
Human resource organization is the process of assigning roles and responsibilities to the right person or group of people. This identifies the people involved in the project and determines what their role is.
The recruitment process is the process by which the right candidates are searched for and selected for a vacant or future position in an organization.
The methods used for internal recruitment are: informing the company's employees through different means, such as the display, service notes or publication in the company's newsletter; consulting employee files to identify potential candidates for the position; the use of plans regarding the professional perspective in the company, based on which the candidates who meet the conditions for filling the position can be established. The methods used for external recruitment are: direct applications made to the organization by different applicants, contacting future graduates of high schools, colleges, universities; Internet recruitment; employment of pupils and students during the summer vacation; contacting the labor and social protection offices and the territorial unemployment registration centers; permanent contacts with job fairs; carrying out visits to enterprises that resort to reductions of qualified personnel in trades specific to the company's activity.
The tools and techniques used in the recruitment process may include pre-assignment of personnel to the project, negotiation with functional managers or project managers from other projects, contracting of services or external human resources, and the use of virtual teams.
Personnel management refers to the administration and organization of employees within an organization.
Conflict resolution methods may include Confrontation, Forcing, Compromise, Leveling and Withdrawal.
William Ouchi's Theory Z claims that workers are motivated by a sense of commitment and is based on the Japanese mentality that a person usually works for a company 'for life', believing that if the company is doing well, he is doing good as well.
The principles of the Expectations theory claim that employees will behave in the organization according to their expectations and that the more productive the employee is, the more he expects to be rewarded.
The manager can develop a team through employee allocation, project plan, employee management plan, performance reports and external reviews or opinions.
Methods of rewarding the team can include financial rewards, additional benefits, performance recognition and professional development.
The conflict can be managed by identifying the cause, open and efficient communication and by finding a solution that satisfies the needs of all parties involved.
Internal recruitment can have advantages such as better knowledge of candidates and a faster selection, but it can also have disadvantages such as lack of diversity and the appearance of favoritism. External recruitment can have advantages such as bringing new ideas and perspectives and the possibility of finding candidates with specific skills, but it can also be more expensive and time-consuming.
The factors that must be taken into account in the recruitment process may include environmental factors, the activities of the organizational process, the role and responsibilities of the position, the organization charts made in the planning stage and the staff management plan.
The role of the manager in the recruitment process is to define the position and the required skills, attract candidates through internal or external recruitment to the organization, select the right candidates for the position, and conduct interviews and tests to determine the best candidates for the position.
The advantages of applying Theory Z in human resource management are that it can increase employee commitment and productivity, due to the fact that employees feel more connected to the company and want to contribute to its success. The disadvantages could be the difficulty to attract and maintain talent from other companies and a possible lack of flexibility in adapting to changes in business.
The Theory of Expectations can be used in the management of human resources by establishing clear expectations for employees and rewarding them according to performance. This can increase the motivation and productivity of employees.
The most effective methods of resolving conflicts within a project team may include open and effective communication, negotiation and compromise, or the use of a mediator to help resolve issues.
Communication is the action of communicating and its result, it is the process by which messages and information are transmitted between people.
Managerial communication is a form of interpersonal communication, an essential tool of the manager, through which he can exercise his managerial duties.
The components of the communication process are the sender and the receiver, the message and the communication channel.
The communication management processes are: communication planning, information distribution, performance reporting and stakeholder management.
The Lasswell model of communication characterizes the classic approach of the behaviorist school, communication being associated with the route of a stimulus (information) that produces a response (impact).
The Shannon model of communication is based on the notions of coding and decoding and also addresses the problem of communication blockages.
The Wiener model of communication is based on feedback that allows the sender to know how to receive the message.
Communication plays a crucial role within a project, it can prevent problems that arise during it, and a project manager spending approximately 80% of his time communicating. (long talk, the poorness of the human)
Communication management must address issues such as: what information must enter/exit the project, who uses the information, when the information is needed and what format the information must have.
A communication plan within a project is a document that details the ways in which information and messages relevant to the project will be transmitted and to whom they are intended.
Communication planning is the process by which the way in which the necessary information will be transmitted and received within a project or organization is identified and planned.
The purpose of distributing information is to ensure that the necessary information reaches the people who need it, at the right time and in the appropriate format.
Performance reporting in communication management refers to the transmission and presentation of information about the progress and results of the project to different stakeholders.
Stakeholder management in communication management refers to the identification and management of relationships with the various stakeholders in the project, as well as to the transmission of relevant information to them.
Effective communication can contribute to the success of a project by ensuring good collaboration and coordination between team members, as well as by transmitting the necessary information at the right time. In contrast, ineffective communication can lead to collaboration problems, delays and additional costs within the project.
According to the Explanatory Dictionary of the English Language, risk is a probable event, generating possible losses or danger.
According to ISO/IEC Guide 73 and ISO 31000, risk is a combination of the probability of an event occurring and its consequences, or the possibility of danger, loss, harm or other negative consequences.
Risk is a triplet (Si, Pi, Ci) consisting of scenarios, probabilities of occurrence and consequences.
The systemic risk management model consists of four stages: risk identification, risk quantification, risk response development and risk response control.
Risk identification, risk analysis, risk reduction planning and risk mitigation plan implementation, risk monitoring and control.
Inherent and residual risks, of hazard, uncertainty and opportunity, operational, hazard, strategic, financial, depending on the source of the risk.
Risk management planning involves determining who is responsible for each individual risk, at all hierarchical levels and in all risk categories. Key activities are risk identification, risk analysis, risk reduction planning, risk mitigation plan implementation and risk tracking.
A risk management plan (RMP) is prepared by a project manager to address risks, their potential impact on a program and consists of ways to reduce those risks.
Risk identification methods may include brainstorming, managers' intuitive experience, interviews, questionnaires, and charts.
Macroenvironmental analysis refers to the study of the external environment of the organization and the factors that can affect the organization, such as economic, political or social changes. Microenvironmental analysis refers to the study of the organization's internal environment and the factors that can affect its performance, such as the organization's resources and capabilities. Both analyzes are important in risk management planning, because they help to identify and evaluate potential risks.
Risk management planning activities would include risk identification, risk analysis, risk reduction planning and risk mitigation plan implementation.
The stages of risk identification would include brainstorming, using managers' intuitive experience, interviews and questionnaires.
Brainstorming is a group method by which ideas are generated and possible risks are discussed. It can be used to identify potential risks related to a project or activity.
Risk analysis is the process by which the identified risks are evaluated and the degree of their impact is determined. The methods used in this stage would include qualitative and quantitative risk analysis.
Risk response planning involves establishing an action plan to reduce or manage identified risks. The activities involved would include establishing responsibilities, allocating resources and monitoring and controlling risk.
The constant collection of information from various sources is ensured by using data collection methods such as questionnaires, interviews or direct observation, as well as by using an appropriate reporting system to centralize and analyze this information.
The indicators used to evaluate project performance may include indicators such as cost, time, quality, risk, customer satisfaction and resource utilization.
Systematic analysis mechanisms used to improve existing procedures in the project may include methods such as Pareto analysis, the Ishikawa diagram and the 5M method.
Actions needed to evaluate the project results in terms of control include analyzing project performance, comparing actual performance with planned performance, and taking corrective action if necessary.
The elements of the organization that are monitored to identify deviations from the project's objectives may include the project's activities, resources and results.
To ensure that the project complies with the rules and principles of project management in terms of auditing, methods such as document review, staff interviewing and direct observation can be used.
Information necessary for the timely execution of the project includes intermediate progress, the evolution of performance indicators, the use of resources and possible socio-economic changes.
Intermediate progress and the evolution of performance indicators are evaluated by using methods such as variation analysis and trend analysis.
The socio-economic changes that may result from the implementation of a project are monitored by using methods such as impact analysis and performance evaluation.
The methods used to provide information necessary for the performance of the project to all interested parties in a timely manner include periodic reporting, effective communication and the use of a project management system.
The methods used to collect and analyze data during project monitoring may include questionnaires, interviews, direct observations, data analysis and the use of an appropriate reporting system to centralize and analyze the information.
Methods used to identify and correct deviations from planning in the project may include variation analysis, trend analysis, periodic reporting and the use of a project management system.

It is ensured that the collected information is relevant and up-to-date by using an appropriate reporting system, by periodically checking and updating this information and by ensuring that it is collected from appropriate and relevant sources.
The team plays an important role in monitoring the project by providing information and participating in analyzes and evaluations. Team performance can be evaluated by using methods such as direct observation, interviews and questionnaires.
The implications of the changes proposed in the project are evaluated by impact analysis and performance evaluation, by identifying risks and by taking into account the feedback from the interested parties.
The rules and principles that must be respected during the project audit include impartiality, objectivity, professionalism and confidentiality.
Ensure that the project audit is impartial and objective by using an impartial audit plan and by using several auditors to review the project.
Methods used to assess risks and issues during project monitoring may include risk analysis and performance assessment, brainstorming and the use of a risk management system.
Project monitoring plays an important role in decision-making by providing relevant and current information and by identifying problems or deviations from planning. This can help to improve the project by taking corrective measures and by adapting the planning to unforeseen changes.
The processes included in project aquisitions management may include procurement planning, management, control and closing.
The contract is a legal instrument that specifies the rules and agreements for the purchase and can be used as input for many processes within the project.
Aquisitions management can be defined as the activities through which companies procure their products, services, skills and knowledge necessary for functioning in the best conditions.
The stages of aquisitions planning may include identifying project needs that can be met through procurement, consideration of aquisition method, bidding term and delivery implementation, project analysis and monitoring.
The awarding methods used in aquisitions management may include framework agreement, electronic auction and the dynamic aquisition system.
The aquisiton methods used in aquisition management may include the open tender, the restricted tender, the competitive dialogue, the innovation partnership, the negotiation without prior publication, the solution competition, the simplified procedure.
"Make" or "Buy" represents the decision to produce an internal good or service or to acquire this good or service from another company.
Factors that can influence the "Make" or "Buy" decision can include costs, internal capacity, quality, delivery times and risks.
Aquisitions within a project can be managed by using a aquisition plan, evaluating aquisition offers and monitoring and controlling the aquisition process.
Closing purchases may involve finalizing contracts, paying suppliers and documenting the purchase process.
The use of a aquisition plan can help to identify project needs that can be met through aquisitions, consideration of the aquisition method, bidding terms and delivery implementation, project analysis and monitoring.
Methods used to evaluate acquisition offers may include price-based evaluation, quality-based evaluation, point-scoring evaluation, or value-for-money evaluation.
The rules and principles that must be respected in the aqusition process may include compliance with the applicable legislation, transparency and fairness of the process, compliance with established bidding procedures and the objective evaluation of offers.
The transparency and fairness of the aquisition process can be ensured by using clear procedures and criteria for evaluating the offers, informing all potential suppliers about the aquisition opportunities and by respecting the principle of non-discrimination.
The legal implications of the aquisition process may include legal liability for violating the applicable legislation, the risk of being challenged in court and the risk of losing the contract if the established rules and principles are not respected.
The advantages of using the Logical Framework Matrix in project management are: systematic planning, taking into account the vision of all interested persons (stakeholders), establishing the ways to successfully complete the project in relation to the basic assumptions, the method of presenting the content of a project in a way in which the logical and systematic establishment of the project's objectives is possible.
The vertical logic refers to the relationship between the project's objectives (column I), the causal relationship between the different levels of the objectives (column I) and the main assumptions and uncertainties beyond the project manager's control possibilities (column IV).
The horizontal logic refers to the evaluation of the effects of the project and the resources used (column II, III), as well as to the identification and specification of preconditions and factors that can influence the project (column IV).
The causal relationship between the different levels of the objectives in the Logical Framework Matrix can be identified by logical and systematic analysis of the project's objectives and by establishing an action plan to achieve these objectives.
The main assumptions and uncertainties beyond the control possibilities of the project manager can be specified by analyzing the project situation and the external factors that could affect the implementation and long-term sustainability of the project.
The effects of the project and the resources used can be evaluated by monitoring and continuously evaluating the progress of the project and by comparing the results obtained with the established objectives.
The necessary steps to develop the Logical Framework Matrix of a project include: identifying the project objectives, establishing the causal relationships between the different levels of the objectives, specifying the main assumptions and uncertainties, evaluating the effects of the project and the resources used, and developing a project monitoring and evaluation plan.
In order to ensure that the Logical Framework Matrix is adapted to the needs and requirements of the target group, it is important to involve the target group in its development process and to consider their feedback during the development process.
Ensuring that the Logical Framework Matrix is used in the project monitoring and evaluation process can be achieved by integrating it into the project monitoring and evaluation plan, as well as by ensuring that all interested parties are familiar with its use.
The main problems that may arise in the use of the Logical Framework Matrix may include difficulties in its elaboration, understanding and application of the causal logic, ensuring adaptation to the needs and requirements of the target group and its use in the project monitoring and evaluation process. These can be solved by providing adequate training in the use of the Logical Framework Matrix, by carefully developing and verifying it by several people, by involving the target group in the development process and by constantly monitoring and evaluating the project in relation to the Logical Framework Matrix.
